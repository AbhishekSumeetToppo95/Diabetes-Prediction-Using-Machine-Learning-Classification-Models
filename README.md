# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning-Classification-Models

## Abstract
Diabetes is considered as one the most dangerous threat to the human mankind. According to International Diabetes Federation 382 million people are living with diabetes across the world. By 2035, this will be doubled as 592 million. Diabetes is a disease that is caused due to the increase in the level of blood glucose. If diabetes is not detected earlier then suffering person in future might also suffer from several other diseases like heart stroke, kidney failure and blindness. At present with the advancement in the field of Data Science we can predict through machine learning models at a very early stage whether a person is having or going to have diabetes in near future or not based on his/her medical reports. 

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a system which can perform early prediction of diabetes for a patient with a higher accuracy by combining the results of different machine learning techniques. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
